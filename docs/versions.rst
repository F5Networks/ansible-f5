Versions
========

There are a number of versions of software the F5 officially supports
that `can be found here`_. This should not be considered the list that
the Ansible modules support though.

We're doing our best to move more towards using the REST API, so with that
in mind, we're also moving many of the Ansible modules along in terms of
supported BIG-IP versions.

Generally speaking, the versions of BIG-IP that are tested and supported
by the Ansible modules include:

  * 11.6.0
  * 12.0.0
  * 12.1.0

So that the oldest that we're willing to aim for is when the REST interface
went GA.

If you're seriously interested in the Ansible modules, then consider it a
reason to upgrade if you have not yet done so.
