Synopsis
--------

* Manages L2/L3 configuration of a BIG-IP via iWorkflow. This module is useful in the event that you have a new BIG-IP that does not yet have VLANs and Self-IPs configured on it. You can use this module on a discovered, managed, device to configure those settings via iWorkflow. You **do not** need touse this module if you have an existing BIG-IP that has its L2/L3 configuration already complete. In that cae, it is sufficient to just use the ``iworkflow_managed_device`` module and iWorkflow will automatically discover the node information for you.


Requirements (on host that executes module)
-------------------------------------------

  * f5-sdk >= 2.2.0
  * iWorkflow >= 2.1.0

Notes
-----

.. note::
    - Requires the f5-sdk Python package on the host. This is as easy as pip install f5-sdk.
    - Requires the netaddr Python package on the host. This is as easy as pip install netaddr.
    - This module does not support updating of existing nodes that were created with a ``cli_password_credential``. The onboarding process will change your device's ``cli_username_credential`` password, which will prevent you from using this module (without knowing the password) a second time.
    - For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/ansible-f5.
