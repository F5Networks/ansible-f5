Parameter classes
=================

The modules use a Parameter class that acts as a rudimentary two-way adapter. This class adapts data in the following ways:

- Ansible module parameters submitted by the user into REST API attributes.
- REST API attributes into Ansible module parameters for comparison and internal data structures.

This method has served most modules well, though for a number of modules, the abstraction has been difficult to work with. This largely stems from instances where:

- The `api_map` maps resource attribute names to Ansible module parameter names that are similarly named but have wildly different values.
- When a name conflict results in not knowing "how to best" determine if you are dealing with the API's values or the module's values. We have side-stepped this problem in certain situations by checking for the existence of the `kind` key and comparing it to what we know to be the _real_ `kind` key for the resource.
- We need to include resource attributes in the `updatables` key because there is no other way to get them into the `api_params` method. The error is doing this even if that `updatables` addition is not an Ansible module parameter. The `updatables` list is intended to be a list of **only** Ansible module parameter names.
- It has been difficult to do Difference engine comparisons if the API values are not in the `updatables` array because only those values are diff'd.

In an attempt to settle the difficulty of using the "big adapter", a different pattern is being tested where different classes (inheriting from a `Parameters` base class) will be used for the Ansible module parameters (`ModuleParameters`) and the REST API parameters (`ApiParameters`).

Additionally, the base `Parameters` class will be changing its base definition to remove the `__getattr__` definition that it has. This definition has introduced an added layer of difficulty when debugging problems because it implicitly swallows and errors that may be raised by invalid "dot" attribute access. For example, `self.want.baz` where exceptions raised in `baz` may be swallowed. The only indication that this has happened is that a post `q.q` call will never happen.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

   ...
   q.q("started here")
   self.want.baz   # <-- raises exception internally
   q.q("ended here")

In the above (when the situation that I described above happens) the second `q.q` call will never happen. There will be no entry in the `q` log file location, but success of the module may actually happen! This is a can of worms, so we need to eliminate it before we regret it.

The base `Parameters` class will also have it's signature changed from:

.. code-block:: python

   def __init__(self, params=None):

To a version that allows for a free-form of parameters and selectively chooses "special" parameters to do key things with. The new signature is:

.. code-block:: python

   def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

This allows us to expand on what the "valid" kwargs to the init method are. To begin with, there are two args that the base `Parameters` classes will know about. They are:

- `params`
- `client`

The former is no different than the way things work today; the exception being that you will need to be explicit when supplies params to a `Parameters` derived class because `params` is no longer just assumed to be the default. To change your code would require the following:

.. code-block:: python

   # legacy version
   self.want = Parameters(self.client.module.params)

Be changed to:

.. code-block:: python

   # current version
   self.want = ModuleParameters(params=self.client.module.params)

The later `client` parameter is new to the `Parameters` base class. In existing code bases it is possible to add this functionality to your concrete `Parameter` classes, but it is not obvious how, nor well-documented.

For example, today the following would need to be accomplished:

.. code-block:: python

   self.want = Parameters()
   self.want.client = self.client
   self.want.update(self.client.module.params)

You can change this to the following:

.. code-block:: python

   self.want = ModuleParameters(
       client=self.client,
       params=self.client.module.params
   )

Any concrete params class that inherits from the `Parameters` base class will be able to use the method shown above.

The `client=` feature seems like it was added only to make the above easier and more explicit. That, however, was more an unintended consequence than a goal. The *real* purpose for doing the above was for the following:

- BIG-IQ
- Unit tests (for BIG-IQ)

.. note::

   My assumptions here are based on the work that others have done in this area. When I wrote this, I did not have first-hand experience with BIG-IQ; only the iWorkflow codebase (which was originally a fork of BIG-IQ).

You see, the BIG-IQ code-base will require situations where the concrete `Parameters` classes themselves will be responsible for reading data from the remote device.

This is because, in many circumstances, we cannot know all of the resources and their attributes that we need to deal without, without querying for data using a resource attribute itself as input.

Surprisingly, we know this is going to be a problem, because we've already experienced it. Where? In iWorkflow.

You see, iWorkflow's REST API was created from a fork (long ago in a galaxy far far away) of an older BIG-IQ code base. Many of the similarities have disappeared over time, but the one thing that has remained constant is that BIG-IQ's API is one where you have to do a **HUGE** amount of "extra" work to just do what you need to do.

That means that concrete Parameters will need to do this work so that the user does not need to. For example, you're setting yourself up for failure if you plan on using `Postman` to work with your BIG-IQ. Good luck with that. The Ansible modules deliberately provide a layer of "niceness" that you simply do not get with direct API communication.

But that's A-OK, because all that direct API stuff and what concrete class needs to have a client really all boils down to "implementation details". The developers (you because you're reading this) need to worry about it; the users do not.
