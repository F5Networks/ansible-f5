F5 Ansible Docs
===============

This project implements a set of Ansible modules for the BIG-IP platform from F5 Networks.

You can use these modules to create, edit, update, and delete configuration objects on a BIG-IP.

The code is open source, and |f5_ansible_github|. Additionally, some modules have been promoted to the |ansible_core| and |ansible_extras|.
